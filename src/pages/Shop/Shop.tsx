        Nested Routing is the general idea of coupling segments of the URL to component hierarchy and data. React
        Router's nested routes were inspired by the routing system in Ember.js circa 2014. The Ember team realized that
        in nearly every case, segments of the URL determine:

        The layouts to render on the page
        The data dependencies of those layouts
        React Router embraces this convention with APIs for creating nested layouts coupled to URL segments and data
    </div>

export default Shop
